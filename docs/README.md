# Giga DataOps Platform: Superset

The Giga DataOps Platform is a data platform developed by Thinking Machines Data Science
in coordination with UNICEF Giga. The objective of the platform is to ingest school data
from various sources, applying concepts from master data management and data governance
in order to produce a single source of truth—the **School Master Data**—which will then
be used by consumers and downstream applications.

This repository contains the configurations for the **Superset** service of the
Platform.
